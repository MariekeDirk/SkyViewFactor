# SVF
Aim of the project is to compute the Sky View Factor for a point, a region and for the whole Netherlands.  
As a base the point cloud data set of the height map of the Netherlands is used (http://www.ahn.nl/index.html) to determine the height of obstacles that interfere with the view of the sky.
